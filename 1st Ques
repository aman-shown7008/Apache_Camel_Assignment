Create a CAMEL program to insert csv data to MySQL Database.


import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

public class CsvToMysqlRoute extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("file:/path/to/csv/file?noop=true")
            .unmarshal().csv()
            .split(body())
            .to("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?user=myuser&password=mypassword")
            .setBody(simple("INSERT INTO mytable (col1, col2, col3) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"))
            .to("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?user=myuser&password=mypassword");
    }
}

Explanation-

In this, we have first use the from method to read the CSV file located at /path/to/csv/file. The [noop=true] option tells Camel to 
leave the file alone after it has been processed, so we don't need to worry about accidentally deleting or moving the file.

Next, we use the unmarshal().csv() method to convert the CSV data into a list of lists of strings.
Each list represents a row in the CSV file, and each element in the list represents a column.

We then use the split method to split the list of rows into individual rows, so we can process each row separately.

For each row, we use the to method to send the row data to the MySQL database using the JDBC driver. 
The JDBC URL includes the database name, and the user and password parameters specify the credentials needed to connect to the database.

Finally, we use the setBody method to construct an SQL query to insert the data into the mytable table. 
The ? placeholders indicate where the actual data should be inserted, and the simple method specifies the actual data to insert.
We then use the to method again to execute the SQL query on the database.
